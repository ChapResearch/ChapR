# ChapR
The ChapR is a patented remote for controlling FTC, FLL, and FRC robots without a PC. It allows teams to easily set up drive practices and run autonomous programs without bothering the programmer(s) or fighting over the few PCs available. Created in 2013, it has been “sold” to hundreds of teams all over the world, using the “profits” to fund free ChapRs for teams in need. For more information on sales and usage of the device, see [the project website](http://thechapr.com). For more information on the creation of the device, see its [project page](http://chapresearch.com/?page_id=868).
