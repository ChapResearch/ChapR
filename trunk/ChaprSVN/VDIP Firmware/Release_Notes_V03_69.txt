Documentation: Vinculum Firmware User Manual V2.4

Documentation 
- Updated V03.63 Release Notes. "A DRD will return 'Command Failed' if the 
  device it is reading from returns a NAK status to the read. This does not 
  necessarily indicate an error; however, the monitor will return this status 
  to differentiate between a NAK and the device returning a zero length 
  data packet."


Vinculum Firmware: V03.64 25-April-2008

- VDFC Firmware is NOT compatible with the VF2F2 module.


Vinculum Firmware: V03.63 29-February-2008
Documentation: Vinculum Firmware User Manual V2.4

Release Notes
-------------

Fixes:

Disk Commands
- Fix bug when overwriting existing files after performing a SEK operation
  to a cluster boundary.

VDPS Firmware
- Vinculum Firmware Customiser can set USB Slave VID, PID and configuration
  strings for use by VDPS firmware.
  
General
- Improved detection of Low-Speed USB devices.
- Fixed detection and configuration of certain makes and models of disk keys.
- DSD and SSU commands always accept the number of bytes specified in the
  command parameters even if an error has occurred.
- DRD and SSU commands always report the number of bytes received even if
  an error has occurred (in which case this will be zero).

Documentation 
- Updated V03.61 Release Notes. "An RDF command which reads past the end of 
  a file will be padded with 0xFE."
  

Vinculum Firmware: V03.62 7-December-2007
Documentation: Vinculum Firmware User Manual V2.3

Release Notes
-------------

Fixes:

VMUSIC Commands
- Fix VPF command not returning to prompt when it attempts to play a 
  non-existing file.

General
- If the Vinculum is started or reset when the DATAREQ# pin is active it
  will attempt to connect to a device on USB Port 1 then USB Port 2. This
  may not be the same device to which it was connected to before a reset.
  The DATAACK# line will be deasserted if RST# is asserted. It is, however,
  not recommended starting or resetting the Vinculum while in data mode.
  

Vinculum Firmware: V03.61 28-November-2007
Documentation: Vinculum Firmware User Manual V2.3

Release Notes
-------------

Fixes:

Disk Commands
- Removed initial scan of disk for determining free space.
  This means that disks can be used almost immediately after being detected
  by the firmware. The first time an FS or FSE command is called the firmware
  will search the disk and calculate the free space available. The IDD 
  command will not report available disk space until the FS or FSE command
  is called. Detection and handling of a full disk condition has been 
  improved.
- RDF and WRF commands now fully honour the size of data passed to the 
  command before reporting any error messages. This means, for instance, 
  that a WRF command when there is no file opened for writing will expect 
  the number of bytes passed as a parameter before the File Invalid message 
  is reported. Data passed to the command will be ignored. Similarly, an RDF 
  command which reads past the end of a file will be padded with 0xFE.
  You MUST still check that a disk is connected before issuing any commands
  which will access the disk or the command will return the "No Disk" message.
- While a file is open for write prevent use of disk commands which may 
  affect the firmware's ability to continue to access the open file. These 
  commands are RD, CD, DLF and REN.

USB Commands  
- Devices without IN or OUT endpoints are listed in the device list. This is 
  to allow SETUP commands to be sent to these type of devices using the SSU 
  command. They cannot be accessed with DSD or DRD commands nor should they 
  be used in data mode.
- SSU command error fixed to allow a command with a data size of zero bytes 
  to be sent to a device.

VMUSIC Commands
- Add Pause command (VP) to pause playback. If other VMusic playback commands 
  are called during pause then the selected track starts playing regardless 
  of whether the device was in the paused state.
- Add Skip Directory command (VSD) to V3A and VRA commands. This will exit 
  the directory where the currently playing file is stored and start playing 
  from the next directory in line. Note that sub-directories and MP3 files 
  in the current directory are skipped.
- VF and VB commands added to fast forward or rewind approximately 5 seconds.
- Added VRR command added to randomly select files to play. This does not 
  shuffle files but simply plays tracks at random.
- Elapsed time during playback is preceded by "T " (0x54, 0x20) to prevent 
  applications wrongly detecting SCS playback stop message.
- After "Playing" message 5 lines of information from the file's ID3 tag is 
  displayed. These are, in order, Track Number, Title, Artist, Album and 
  Composer. A carriage return signifies the end of each tag information. 
  Tags not containing ASCII text are not displayed. 
- Block access to disk commands during playback which may affect the 
  firmware's ability to continue to access the playing file. These commands 
  are DIR, DIRT, MKD, DLD, RD, CD, DLF and REN.

General
- Modify codepage to support ASCII character codes in the range 128 to 255.
  Allows use of two-byte character sets.
- Fixed bug in SPI interface when transferring large data blocks from disk
  to the Monitor. This only occurred when more than 512 bytes were requested
  and the period between SPI polls exceeded 2ms.

Known Issues:

- If the Vinculum is started or reset when the DATAREQ# pin is active there
  may be some spurious data sent to the Monitor. This typically happens only
  when device configured in QD 0 is on USB Port 1. 
  It is not recommended to start the Vinculum firmware in data mode.

Vinculum Firmware: V03.56 1-August-2007
Documentation: Vinculum Firmware User Manual V2.1

Release Notes
-------------

Fixes:

- All Firmwares corrected DRD command issue when reading devices in USB Port
  2 and no device in USB Port 1. Occasionally the data read from the device
  on USB Port 2 would incorrecly be returned as 0xBB.
- All Firmwares able to detect and ignore unsupported BOMS (disk) devices,
  including incorrect sector sizes, unformatted drives or unsupported file
  systems.
- All Firmwares have improved detection and handling of full disks.
- All Firmwares now list correct number of files in root directory on FAT12
  and FAT16 formatted disks.

  on Monitor at start of each track ("P" in SCS Mode). "Stopped" displayed
  when all tracks finished playing ("S" in SCS Mode). Elapsed time of 
  currently playing track displayed in format specified by IPA or IPH mode
  of the Monitor.
- The monitor can connect to CDC devices in VDAP firmware by using the 
  DATAREQ/DATAACK pins. This is at the expense of utilising the DSR/DTR pins 
  from the CDC device but allows connection when required. VCDC firmware 
  connects automatically to CDC devices upon insertion and all pins are usable
  from the CDC device. 
- "Found It" message no longer displayed when a firmware upgrade file 
  (FTRFB.FTD) found on disk.
- Reduced latency in writing files sequentially onto large disk volumes.
  
Known Issues:
