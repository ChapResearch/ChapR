Thank you...Your device has been instrumental in our success this year
	- Neutrinos (FTC 6433); Lakeland, Florida
My teams are estatic to be able to run their bots at the same time!
	- RoboWolves & iBots (FTC 8070 & 8071); 
We have tested and are very happy with the 1 ChapR we purchased. As part of this event, in order to more easily put robots under the control of people besides the kids on my team, and without having to mess around with a computer I'd love to run several of our robots including the sumo bots with ChapRs.  Is there any way I could get 3 in hand by next Monday, 6 days away? I would happily pay expedited shipping fees on top of the normal purchase price.

congrats in developing such an amazing and nifty product, we students at ViperBots are absolutely astonished.
Every team of ours was just dying to get their hands on it so they wouldn't have to use a bulky laptop everywhere
The casing is durable and fantastic, surviving many falls and Robot Shop mishaps.
