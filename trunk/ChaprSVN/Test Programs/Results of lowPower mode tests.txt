Notes on 5/9/13 Testing

Trial 1:
Tried to reset name to NoCreativitySoIntel, and it said it had set it to NoCreativitySo
When the brick tried to find it, it took a while and only found ChapR-1, which it connected to (the old name)
waitForStart button didn't release the waitForStart (but worked during boot)

Trial 2:
Properly named the ChapR ISS Rules: Rob (only difference was having the serial port open upon download)
Found the ChapR quickly, though I had to close and reopen the search
waitForStart still isn't working

Trial 3:
Downloaded button tester onto the 6710 brick
Tried to connect to the brick using ChapR (while it was connected to my computer), without any results good or bad
The ChapR went into "zombie mode" (the light flashed)
Rebooted brick and reconnected
WFS button worked properly

Trial 4:
Renamed the ChapR without opening the serial monitor
Set the power LED to blink slowly when in low power mode
When I connected it saw the old name, but once it was connected to the ChapR it registered the new one
The power LED remained solid even though it had been at least 15 seconds (greater than both the thresholds)
The WFS button didn't work

Trial 5:
the power LED blinked only when the ChapR had been disconnected from the brick
