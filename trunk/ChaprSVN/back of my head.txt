take out the battery when working on software
take out the lowPowerOperation comments

RIGHT HERE - where i am in code
SKETCHY - code that should be fixed
TODO - code that needs to be fixed

ask Vandegrift if we can use their quotes

potential problems
 - confusing the hold down the power button and have nothing happen (can't tell if the battery is dead)
 - latency when using LabView
 - all the way forward on the sticks stops motors in LabView (would stop for a brief moment)
 - battery life (good!)
 - having to reboot both the NXt and ChapR
 - not being able to tell the battery life (flashing power LED and making icky noise repeatedly)
 - switch idea (not happening)
 - adding a belt clip? (customizable with personality)

LabView stops pairing while a program is running

needs a board spin to change the silk screen and get rid of the extra holes (and potentially monitor battery)

**LabView personality shouldn't send -128 on the up stick

did check FCS - sends 127 (should add to website)

randomly got a bluetooth store is full error and the chapr tried to connect, but disconnected instantly (and repeated this process)
  - must delete a few contacts on the brick

the openFileToRead() command appears to return the wrong handle (always 0?)

USB pairing doesn't work if the ChapR boots with an NXT already plugged in

Coach's Version - ChapR-14
in pairing mode - icky noise every once in a while
in normal mode (and not connected) - icky noise on press of the action button (and randomly otherwise), but swallows several button presses afterwards

WFS is sticky on NXT-G
kill switch didn't work the first time?

Old Version - ChapR-15
*connected to the computer via programmer (with a battery in) and reset using the Serial monitor, but the confirm tone sounded without the BT light flashing (bricked the ChapR!)
	same procedure and it worked fine
*made the "boop" noise when going into pairing mode

Times When ChapR Has Locked Up (Old version)
stopped button tester, then let it sit for a while (both LEDs were on and it wouldn't turn off) - ChapR15
tried to load new settings from a USB first in port 1, which got an icky noise, then in port 2, which just sat there (all lights solid) - ChapR15

*none of the above are repeatable?!

**ChapR-19 killed itself while trying to flash VDIP (inserted USB before pressing !); BT LED won't come on
**ChapR-15 had the same symptoms but that happened when I tried to boot it

kill switch won't work the first time if the ChapR is plugged into the computer (not a bug)
