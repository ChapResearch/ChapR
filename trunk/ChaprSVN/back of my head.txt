take out the battery when working on software
take out the lowPowerOperation comments

RIGHT HERE - where i am in code
SKETCHY - code that should be fixed
TODO - code that needs to be fixed

ask Vandegrift if we can use their quotes

potential problems
 - confusing the hold down the power button and have nothing happen (can't tell if the battery is dead)
 - latency when using LabView
 - all the way forward on the sticks stops motors in LabView (would stop for a brief moment)
 - battery life (good!)
 - having to reboot both the NXt and ChapR
 - not being able to tell the battery life (flashing power LED and making icky noise repeatedly)
 - switch idea (not happening)
 - adding a belt clip? (customizable with personality)

LabView stops pairing while a program is running

needs a board spin to change the silk screen and get rid of the extra holes (and potentially monitor battery)

**LabView personality shouldn't send -128 on the up stick

did check FCS - sends 127 (should add to website)

randomly got a bluetooth store is full error and the chapr tried to connect, but disconnected instantly (and repeated this process)
  - must delete a few contacts on the brick

the openFileToRead() command appears to return the wrong handle (always 0?)
