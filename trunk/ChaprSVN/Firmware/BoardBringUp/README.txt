IMPORTANT!  All of the files in this directory are from ../ChapR
except BoardBringUp.ino.  They are "externals" that are managed by
SVN and are only edited when working on the mainline ChapR code.
You can look at the SVN properties for the  BoardBringUp directory
to edit the externals if you have to...but you probably won't need to.

!!!! YOU SHOULD NOT UPDATE ANY FILES OTHER THAN:  BoardBringUp.ino !!!!
