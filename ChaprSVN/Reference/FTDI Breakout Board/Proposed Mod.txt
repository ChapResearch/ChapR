Proposed Mod to convert the FTDI basic break-out
--------------------------------------------------
WHEREAS
- we have (and stock) the FTDI basic breakout board from Sparkfun for
  use with the ChapR
- we have "bricked" a VDIP (and may end-up doing it again sometime)
- the board is relatively cheap

PROPOSAL
- we convert one of the breakout boards to something that will work with
  the FTDI VDIP reflashing software VPROG

PROCEDURE
- it "looks" the easiest thing to do would be to cut the (very small) pin
  # 2 right on the chip (disconnecting DTR)
- then solder bridge pin #3 to pin #2, effectively wiring RTS to the same
  pin that used to be DTR
- then the 6 pin connector would still be cool, except it would have RTS
  where DTR used to be
- it would need to be well-marked!
- IT WORKED!
- see the VDIP firmware directory for more information
