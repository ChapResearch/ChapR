FRC cRIO Compatibility

Switching modes
     - use red button as a way of switching between modes:
     - teleOp
       - takes input from two joysticks
       - unlimited time in teleOp
     - matchMode (called practice on Driver Station)
       - starts with 10 seconds of autnomous, beeping to indicate
         each second
       - squeeps and starts teleOp, ending it after 2 min 20 sec
     - matchConfig.txt
       - allows user to determine number of seconds in autonomous and teleOp
       - zero for either mode just skips the mode
     **clicking red set disabled mode (so matchMode would have to be restarted)	
     **clicking black toggles disabled mode (matchMode is paused)
     **if nothing is running when you hit the black button, something starts up
     **if nothing is running when you hit the red button, it reports your current mode
     	  **if pressed again in under 2 seconds, the mode will change and be reported
Send digital inputs
     - readFromFile("digitalIn.txt")
       - see options below (all in ASCII)
       - figure out failure modes
     - entered into EEPROM as a setting
     - personality 3 reads EEPROM and sends digital IO
Send analog inputs
     - readFromFile("analogIn.txt")
       - see options below (all in ASCII)
       - figure out failure modes
     - entered into EEPROM as a setting
     - personality 3 reads EEPROM and sends analog IO
       - each of four analog inputs is a U16 (0 to 65535)
       - interpreted as I16, and multiply by 0.0048875855
       - empirical study and web research needed
       - scale on driver station is 0 to 5 (although any values, positive
         or negative can be entered)
Toggling wait for start
In-situ upgrade of EEPROM data
   - recognizing current(past) EEPROM version, recovering GOOD data translating to new format
Emergency stop
	  - research the difference between disabling teleOp and killing it
	  - though keep in mind the cRIO currently has to be rebooted every time the ChapR
	    is turned off when connected
Support other controllers
Default to 2468
Testing with other BT/Serial dongles
