*Software
XPower Saver Mode
	After 5 min, the power LED blinks and the BT module stops sending joystick info (can be escaped by hitting the joysticks)
	Only saved us 10 mA
-Zombie Mode
	After 10 min, everything turns off (must reboot to escape)
	Saved 30 or 40 mA from putting BT module into deep sleep mode
	(Saved 30 mA from not having either joystick)
XMethod of renaming ChapR (integrate the NameReset into the main program)
-USB pairing for competitions
	plug uSB into ChapR and NXT to learn BT address, then unplug the USB and plug in the controllers
-Fix the reboot needed after first BT pairing (master/slave issue)
-ChapR Library
	Special ChapR debugging (if a waitForChapR is reached, program waits for a button press if it is connected to a ChapR)
	Emergency Stop (if the ChapR loses connection, or is diliberately turned off, everything stops)
-Decide on a BT ID

*Hardware
-Design a single board
	Pro-mini, smaller BT device etc. (FTDI Breakout to allow users to reprogram)
-Battery issue (big vs little battery)
-LEDS (blue vs red)
-Speaker
-WaitForStart() button

*Case
-Battery pack on the bottom with the belt clip on the battery cover
-3D printed case on top
