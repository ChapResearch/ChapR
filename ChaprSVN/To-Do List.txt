TODO AS OF AUG 24, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*Software
1. NXT USB Pairing
 	X get BT ID and pair
 - display image to show ChapR is connected (something Westlakey)
 - make sure BT is on (will be implemented with personalities)
	X2. Fix master/slave issue
 	X BT pairing
 	X USB pairing
	the brick works best when it is rebooted after a USB pairing session (it would be nice to do this with software)
	reboot brick, then reset ChapR (use a 2 in EEPROM, then decrement to indicate phase change)
**works with NXT - A, which is now in the NXT mode, but not with Rachel NXT (which went through a hardware reset)
**doesn't get a chance to say it's connected, so it connects after the reset only (no way of knowing if master/slave flip occurred at the moment)
	X3. Kill switch
	turn on (hold till lights go on)
	button pressed (kills program)
	turn off (hold till lights go off); see button pressed, wait x seconds, turn off both lights, lower powerhold line
	X4. Flash drive
 	X naming
 	X personality
 	X timeout
**has trouble reading a flash drive on a low power battery
	X5. Build naming into main ChapR.ino
	X6. Personality (NXT-G and NXT-RobotC)
	X7. Revist power saving modes
8. BT ID
9. ChapR Library
10. LabView Compatibility
	X11. Matrix Compatibility
12. Board bring-up program
	checks if VDIP program has been flashed
	tests communication to BT and VDIP
	checks versions of each part
	read and write EEPROM
13. Magic String vs Version

**test with another NXT because NXT - A brick will boot strangely if the ChapR is pairing before it has been booted
**sometimes you have to reboot the NXt brick to get it to pair properly

**ChapR wouldn't work with Matrix...?

**Mysteriously disconnects and reconnects after a few minutes

*Hardware
1. v1.0
 - fix transitors
 - 3.3V VDIP
 - capacitors?
 - diffused blue LED
2. template for case
3. buy 50 boards
4. buy parts for 10 boards

OLD TODO BEFORE AUG 24, 2013

*Software
XPower Saver Mode
	After 5 min, the power LED blinks and the BT module stops sending joystick info (can be escaped by hitting the joysticks)
	Only saved us 10 mA
-Zombie Mode
	After 10 min, everything turns off (must reboot to escape)
	Saved 30 or 40 mA from putting BT module into deep sleep mode
	(Saved 30 mA from not having either joystick)
XMethod of renaming ChapR (integrate the NameReset into the main program)
-USB pairing for competitions
	plug uSB into ChapR and NXT to learn BT address, then unplug the USB and plug in the controllers
-Fix the reboot needed after first BT pairing (master/slave issue)
-ChapR Library
	Special ChapR debugging (if a waitForChapR is reached, program waits for a button press if it is connected to a ChapR)
	Emergency Stop (if the ChapR loses connection, or is diliberately turned off, everything stops)
-Decide on a BT ID

*Hardware
-Design a single board
	Pro-mini, smaller BT device etc. (FTDI Breakout to allow users to reprogram)
-Battery issue (big vs little battery)
-LEDS (blue vs red)
-Speaker
-WaitForStart() button

*Case
-Battery pack on the bottom with the belt clip on the battery cover
-3D printed case on top
